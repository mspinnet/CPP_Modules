The United States sets aside a number of days each year to commemorate events, people or public occasions.
These days are called holidays.
Technically, the United States does not celebrate national holidays, but Congress has designated 10 "legal public holidays,"
during which most federal institutions are closed and most federal employees do not work.
Since 1971, a number of these have been fixed on Mondays, so as to afford workers a long holiday weekend.
Seven of the federal legal holidays — New Year’s Day; Washington’s Birthday/ Presidents’ Day; Memorial Day;
Independence Day; Labor Day; Thanksgiving and Christmas — are observed nearly universally throughout the public 
and private sectors They are considered to be American favorite holidays.
